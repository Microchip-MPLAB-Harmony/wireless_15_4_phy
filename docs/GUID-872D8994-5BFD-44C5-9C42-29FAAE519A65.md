# PHY_StopContinuousTransmit Function

## C

```c
void PHY_StopContinuousTransmit(void)
```

## Summary

Stops the continuous transmission on the current channel  

## Description

This function is called to stop the continuous transmission

## Precondition

PHY_Init() should have been called before calling this function. This function will stop the continuous transmission which is started by PHY_StartContinuousTransmit()function.  

## Parameters

None  

## Returns

None  

## Example

```c
PHY_Retval_t retVal = PHY_FAILURE;
uint8_t phyChannel = 15;
PHY_ContinuousTxMode_t txMode = PRBS_MODE;
bool useRandomContent = true;
bool contTxStarted = false;
PibValue_t pibValue;

// Setting Current channel
pibValue.pib_value_8bit = phyChannel;
retVal = PHY_PibSet(phyCurrentChannel, &pibValue);
if(PHY_SUCCESS == retVal)
{
    //Start continuous tx in CW mode
    PHY_StartContinuousTransmit(txMode, useRandomContent);
    contTxStarted = true;
}

if(contTxStarted)
{
    //Stop continuous tx
    PHY_StopContinuousTransmit();
}
```

## Remarks

When continuous tx is stopped, the PHY_Reset function is called. User has to reconfigure the configuration parameters (PHY_ConfigParam_t) which are set by application.
