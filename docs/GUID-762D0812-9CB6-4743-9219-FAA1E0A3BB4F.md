## Summary

List of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance supported by PHY Layer  

## Description

When Transmit function is called with PHYCSMAMode of

*NO_CSMA_NO_IFS* - Immediate Tx and SIFS(Short InterFrameSpacing) between
subsequent frames

*NO_CSMA_WITH_IFS* - Immediate Tx and LIFS (Long InterFrameSpacing) between
subsequent frames

*CSMA_UNSLOTTED* - Hardware CSMA will be performed before packet transmission
with number of retries configured

*CSMA_SLOTTED* - Hardware CSMA will be performed - Used with Beacon
Enabled network - Currently not supported by PHY
## Remarks

None
