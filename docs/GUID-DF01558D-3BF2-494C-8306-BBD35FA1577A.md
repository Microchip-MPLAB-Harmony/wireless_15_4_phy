# PHY_PibSet Function

## C

```c
PHY_Retval_t PHY_PibSet(uint8_t attribute, PibValue_t *value)
```

## Summary

Sets the PHY PIB attribute with value  

## Description

This function is called to set the transceiver information base
attributes. The list of PHY PIB attributes, its default values and
range are described in the above table.
For more information refer ieee_phy_const.h file

## Precondition

PHY_init() should have been called before calling this function.  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| attribute | PHY infobase attribute ID |
| value | Pointer to the PHY infobase attribute value to be set | 

## Returns

*PHY_UNSUPPORTED_ATTRIBUTE* - if the PHY info base attribute is not found 

*PHY_BUSY* - If the PHY is not in PHY_IDLE state.An exception is macBeaconTxTime which can be accepted by PHY even if PHY is not in PHY_IDLE state

*PHY_SUCCESS* - If the attempt to set the PIB attribute was successful

*PHY_TRX_ASLEEP* - If trx is in SLEEP mode and access to trx is required

## Example

```c
PHY_Retval_t retVal = PHY_FAILURE;
uint8_t phyChannel = 15;
uint8_t shortAddr = 0x1234;
PibValue_t pibValue;

// Setting Current channel
pibValue.pib_value_8bit = phyChannel;
retVal = PHY_PibSet(phyCurrentChannel, &pibValue);
if(PHY_SUCCESS == retVal)
{
    //Channel is configured
}

//Setting short Address
pibValue.pib_value_16bit = shortAddr;
retVal = PHY_PibSet(macShortAddr, &pibValue);
if(PHY_SUCCESS == retVal)
{
    //Short Address is configured
}

```
## Remarks
