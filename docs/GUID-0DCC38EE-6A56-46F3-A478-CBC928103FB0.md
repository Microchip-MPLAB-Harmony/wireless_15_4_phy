# PHY_CCAPerform Function

## C

```c
PHY_Retval_t PHY_CCAPerform(void)
```

## Summary

Perform a clear channel assessment  

## Description

This function is used to perform a clear channel assessment on current channel.
using configured CCA mode (can be set using PHY_PibSet of phyCCAMode).
This results in the status of channel is current busy or Idle.

The different CCA modes supported by Transceiver are
The CCA mode

- CCA Mode 1: Energy above threshold. CCA shall report a busy medium
upon detecting any energy above the ED threshold.

- CCA Mode 2: Carrier sense only. CCA shall report a busy medium only upon
the detection of a signal with the modulation and spreading characteristics
of IEEE 802.15.4. This signal may be above or below the ED threshold.

- CCA Mode 3: Carrier sense with energy above threshold. CCA shall report a
busy medium only upon the detection of a signal with the modulation and
spreading characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 with energy above the ED
threshold.

## Precondition

PHY_Init() should have been called before calling this function.  

## Parameters

None  

## Returns

*PHY_CHANNEL_IDLE* - The CCA attempt has detected an idle channel

*PHY_CHANNEL_BUSY* - The CCA attempt has detected a busy channel
 

## Example

```c
PHY_Retval_t retVal = PHY_FAILURE;
uint8_t phyChannel = 15;
PibValue_t pibValue;
bool isChIdle = false;

// Setting Current channel
pibValue.pib_value_8bit = phyChannel;
retVal = PHY_PibSet(phyCurrentChannel, &pibValue);
if(PHY_SUCCESS == retVal)
{
    //Take the Ed sample
    retVal = PHY_CCAPerform();
    if (PHY_CHANNEL_IDLE == retVal)
    {
        isChIdle = true;
    }
}

```
## Remarks

None
