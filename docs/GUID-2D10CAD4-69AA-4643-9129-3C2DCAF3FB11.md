# macMinBE Macro

## C

```c
#define macMinBE (0x4F)

```

## Summary

This macro holds The minimum value of the backoff exponent in the CSMA-CA algorithm.Note that if this value is set to 0, collision avoidance is disabled during the first iteration of the algorithm. Also note that for the slotted version of the CSMACA algorithm with the battery life extension enabled, the minimum value of the backoff exponent will be the lesser of 2 and the value of macMinBE.
