# PHY_TxFrame Function

## C

```c
PHY_Retval_t PHY_TxFrame(PHY_FrameInfo_t *txFrame, PHY_CSMAMode_t csmaMode,
bool performFrameRetry)
```

## Summary

Request to PHY to transmit frame  

## Description

This function is called by the upper layer (MAC/Application) to deliver a
frame to the PHY to be transmitted by the transceiver.

## Precondition

PHY_Init() should have been called before calling this function  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |Comments|
|:----- |:----------- |:-------|
| txFrame | Pointer to the PHY_FrameInfo_t structure or to frame array to be transmitted |
| |txFrame->mpdu | Pointer to the PHY Payload. mpdu[0] should hold the length of the payload(N) + 1 (for length field length) |
| |txFrame->mpdu[1-N] | Hold the phyPayload  
| csmaMode | Indicates mode of csma-ca to be performed for this frame |
| |NO_CSMA_NO_IFS | Immediate Tx and SIFS(Short InterFrameSpacing) between subsequent frames |
| |NO_CSMA_WITH_IFS | Immediate Tx and LIFS (Long InterFrameSpacing) between subsequent frames |
| |CSMA_UNSLOTTED | Hardware CSMA will be performed before packet transmission with number of retries configured |
| |CSMA_SLOTTED | Hardware CSMA will be performed |
| ||Beacon Enabled network - Currently not supported by PHY |
| performFrameRetry | Indicates whether to retries are to be performed for this frame |
| |true | SW retry will be performed for macMaxFrameRetries value |
| |false|SW retry is disabled |

## Returns

*PHY_SUCCESS* - If PHY has accepted the data from the MAC for frame
transmission 
*PHY_BUSY* - If PHY is busy servicing the previous MAC request
 

## Example

```c
uint8_t txBuffer[LARGE_BUFFER_SIZE];
uint8_t txData[] = "Wireless!!!";
PHY_CSMAMode_t csmaMode = CSMA_UNSLOTTED;
bool performRetry = true;
PHY_FrameInfo_t txFrame;

txFrame.mpdu = txBuffer;
txBuffer[0] = sizeof(txData);
memcpy((uint8_t *)&txBuffer[1], txData, sizeof(txData));

if(PHY_SUCCESS == PHY_TxFrame(&txFrame, csmaMode, performRetry))
{
    //Frame transmission initiated successfully
}
```

## Remarks

The return status of PHY_SUCCESS from PHY_TxFrame function indicate PHY layer accepted the request for initiation of transmission. The actual status of Transmission will be reported to higher layer through User callback function (PHY_TxDoneCallback). This function will give the status as SUCCESS, CSMA_FAILURE, RADIO_UNAVAILABLE or NO_ACK for the previous request.
