# bmm_buffer_free Function

## C

```c
void bmm_buffer_free(buffer_t *pbuffer)
```

## Summary

Frees up a buffer  

## Description

This function frees up a buffer. The pointer passed to this function
should be the pointer returned during buffer allocation. The result is
unpredictable if an incorrect pointer is passed.

## Precondition

bmm_buffer_init should have been called before using this function  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| pbuffer | Pointer to buffer that has to be freed  

## Returns

None  

## Example

```c
buffer_t *buffer;
buffer = bmm_buffer_alloc(LARGE_BUFFER_SIZE);

if (buffer != NULL)
{
    //Use the buffer
}

//Buffer Freeing
bmm_buffer_free(buffer);
```

## Remarks

This routine is used by the PHY Layer for allocating the buffer for reception. Number of Buffers should be defined as per application needs before the buffer allocation function. If application allocates the buffer and not freeing them, Trx may not able to continuously receive the packet. So care should be taken when defining the Number of Buffers.
