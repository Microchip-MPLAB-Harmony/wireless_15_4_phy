# PHY_TxDoneCallback Function

## C

```c
void PHY_TxDoneCallback(PHY_Retval_t status, PHY_FrameInfo_t *frame)
```

## Summary

User callback function for the transmission of a frame  

## Description

This callback function SHOULD be defined by the upper layer(Application/MAC)
for getting the status of last transmitted packet. Weak implementation for this function is available in phy_tx_done_cb.c file.

## Precondition

This is a Asynchronous function call for the transmission of a frame  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |Comment|
|:----- |:----------- |---|
| status | Status of frame transmission attempt ||
|        |PHY_SUCCESS |The transaction was responded to by a valid ACK, or, if no ACK is requested, after a successful frame transmission|        
|        |PHY_FRAME_PENDING | Equivalent to SUCCESS and indicating that the ?Frame Pending? bit of the received acknowledgment framas set. |
| |PHY_CHANNEL_ACCESS_FAILURE | Channel is still busy after attempting MAX_CSMA_RETRIES of CSMA-CA. |
| |PHY_NO_ACK | No acknowledgement frames were received during all retry attempts. |
| |PHY_FAILURE | Transaction not yet finished. |
| |PHY_RF_REQ_ABORTED | RF is busy performing Higher priority BLE task and the transmission is aborted |
| |PHY_RF_UNAVAILABLE | RF is currently unavailable for 15.4 subsystem  
| frame | Pointer to the PHY_FrameInfo_t structure or to frame array being transmitted |
| |txFrame->mpdu | Pointer to the PHY Payload. mpdu[0] should hold the length of the payload(N) + 1 (for length field length) |
| |txFrame->mpdu[1-N] | Hold the phyPayload |

## Returns

None  

## Example

```c
void PHY_TxDoneCallback(PHY_Retval_t status, PHY_FrameInfo_t *frame)
{
    // Keep compiler happy.
    status = status;
    frame = frame;
}
```

## Remarks

This function will be invoked by the PHY layer for the transmission of a packet or transmissionfailure reasons.
