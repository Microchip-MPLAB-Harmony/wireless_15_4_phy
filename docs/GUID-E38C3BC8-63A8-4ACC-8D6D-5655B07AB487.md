## Summary

This macro holds The CCA mode 
- CCA Mode 1: Energy above threshold. CCA shall report a busy medium

upon detecting any energy above the ED threshold. 
- CCA Mode 2: Carrier sense only. CCA shall report a busy medium only upon

the detection of a signal with the modulation and spreading characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4. This signal may be above or below the ED threshold. 
- CCA Mode 3: Carrier sense with energy above threshold. CCA shall report a

busy medium only upon the detection of a signal with the modulation and spreading characteristics of IEEE 802.15.4 with energy above the ED threshold.
