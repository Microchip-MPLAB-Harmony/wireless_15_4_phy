# PHY_EdEndCallback Function

## C

```c
void PHY_EdEndCallback(uint8_t energyLevel)
```

## Summary

User callback function for Energy detection  

## Description

This function SHOULD be defined by the upperlayer (Application/MAC layer)
in order to get the energyLevel on the current channel which is being scanned
for a period of scanDuration symbols

## Precondition

This is an Asynchronous function call for the energy scan complete  

## Parameters

| Param | Description |
|:----- |:----------- |
| energyLevel | Measured energy level during ED Scan  With energy_level, the RF input power can be calculated as follows |
|             | PRF[dBm] = RSSI_BASE_VAL[dBm] + 1[dB] x energy_level | 

## Returns

None  

## Example

```c
void PHY_EdEndCallback(uint8_t energyLevel)
{
    int8_t energyLeveldBm = (int8_t) (PHY_GetRSSIBaseVal() + energyLevel);
    energyLevel = energyLevel;
}
```

## Remarks

None
